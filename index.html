Theory
Anomaly detection using autoencoders is a technique in machine learning where autoencoder neural networks are employed to identify irregularities or anomalies in data. Autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning. The basic idea is to train the autoencoder on normal, non-anomalous data and then use it to reconstruct new instances. If the reconstruction error is significantly higher for a particular instance, it might be considered an anomaly.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how anomaly detection using autoencoders typically works:

1. **Autoencoder Architecture:**
   - An autoencoder consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding), and the decoder reconstructs the input from this encoding.
   - The architecture is designed to learn a compact and informative representation of the normal data during training.

2. **Training on Normal Data:**
   - During the training phase, the autoencoder is fed with normal, non-anomalous data. The network learns to encode and decode this data, aiming to minimize the reconstruction error, which is the difference between the input and the reconstructed output.

3. **Reconstruction Error:**
   - After training, the autoencoder is used to reconstruct new data, whether it's normal or potentially anomalous.
   - The reconstruction error is calculated as the difference between the input and the reconstructed output. A higher reconstruction error indicates that the input data differs significantly from what the autoencoder learned during training.

4. **Thresholding:**
   - A threshold is set based on the training dataset's reconstruction errors. This threshold serves as a boundary, distinguishing between normal and anomalous instances.
   - Instances with reconstruction errors above the threshold are considered anomalies.

5. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - When a new instance is presented to the trained autoencoder, its reconstruction error is computed. If the error exceeds the predefined threshold, the instance is flagged as an anomaly.

Key points to note:

- Autoencoders are trained in an unsupervised manner, meaning that they don't require labeled data explicitly indicating anomalies during training.
- The autoencoder learns a compressed representation of the normal data, capturing its underlying patterns.
- Anomalies, being different from the normal patterns, typically result in higher reconstruction errors.
- Choosing an appropriate threshold is crucial and often involves tuning based on validation data or domain knowledge.

Anomaly detection using autoencoders is widely applied in various domains, such as fraud detection, network security, and industrial equipment monitoring, where identifying unusual patterns or behaviors is critical.
Certainly! This code implements an autoencoder for anomaly detection using a neural network architecture. The autoencoder is trained to learn a compressed representation of normal data and is then used to reconstruct input data. Anomaly detection is performed by identifying instances where the reconstruction error is higher than a certain threshold.

Let's break down the code:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The code starts by loading the ECG dataset and splitting it into training and testing sets.
   - The target variable (`target`) is binary, where 1 represents normal instances, and 0 represents anomalies.
   - The training set is further filtered to include only normal instances (`train_data`).

2. **Data Scaling:**
   - Min-max scaling is applied to the training and testing data.

3. **Autoencoder Model Definition:**
   - The autoencoder is defined using the Keras Functional API.
   - It consists of an encoder and a decoder.
   - The encoder has three hidden layers with dropout for regularization.
   - The decoder mirrors the structure of the encoder in reverse order.
   - The latent dimension (`ldim`) is set to 8.

4. **Model Compilation:**
   - The autoencoder model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function.

5. **Model Training:**
   - The model is trained using the training data, both as input and target, to learn the reconstruction pattern.
   - The training is performed for a specified number of epochs (`epochs`) and batch size (`batch_size`).
   - Validation data is used to monitor the model's performance during training.

6. **Plotting Training Loss:**
   - The training and validation loss during each epoch are plotted to visualize the training progress.

7. **Threshold Determination:**
   - A function (`find_threshold`) is defined to calculate the threshold for anomaly detection based on the mean and standard deviation of the reconstruction errors on the training set.

8. **Anomaly Prediction:**
   - Another function (`get_predictions`) is defined to predict anomalies in the test set based on the calculated threshold.
   - The model predicts anomalies if the reconstruction error is higher than the threshold.

9. **Threshold Calculation and Prediction:**
   - The threshold is calculated using the `find_threshold` function on the training set.
   - Anomalies are predicted on the test set using the `get_predictions` function.

10. **Accuracy Calculation:**
    - The accuracy of the anomaly predictions is calculated using `accuracy_score` from scikit-learn.

In summary, this code demonstrates the training of an autoencoder for anomaly detection in ECG data. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct normal instances and is then used to identify anomalies based on the reconstruction error. The threshold for anomaly detection is determined using the training set, and the accuracy of the predictions is evaluated on the test set.
